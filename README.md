## HR_Project_DEPI_G2

# Project Overview

This project is part of our Data Analysis Graduation Project, where we analyze an HR dataset to extract meaningful insights about employee performance, satisfaction, and other key HR metrics. The goal is to apply SQL, Python, and Power BI to clean, analyze, and visualize HR data effectively.

# Dataset Description
The dataset consists of multiple CSV files containing employee information, performance ratings, satisfaction levels, and other HR-related metrics. Below are the key datasets:
	1.	Employee.csv – Contains general employee details (age, department, salary, etc.).
	2.	PerformanceRating.csv – Employee performance evaluation scores.
	3.	SatisfactionLevel.csv – Employee job satisfaction ratings.
	4.	EducationLevel.csv – Employee education qualifications.
	5.	RatingLevel.csv – Rating levels assigned to employees.

# Objectives
	•	Data Cleaning & Preparation: Use SQL & Python to clean, transform, and structure the data.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends, correlations, and key insights about employee performance and satisfaction.
	•	Visualization & Reporting: Use Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports for HR decision-making.

# Tools & Technologies Used
	•	SQL Server – For data storage and queries.
	•	Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.) – For data analysis and visualization.
	•	Power BI – For interactive dashboards and data presentation.
	•	Excel & Power Query – For preliminary data processing.

# Key Insights & Findings (To be updated as the project progresses)
	•	What factors influence employee performance and satisfaction?
	•	How does education level impact performance?
	•	What trends exist in employee attrition and retention?
